Procedures:
This program was created using anaconda 3.6. The libraries that were used numpy 1.16, sci-kit, pandas, etc. This data was collected from Youtube directly and open logs of channel demonetization. The only data that was used from the channels that were analyzed was the amount of subscribers said channel had, the amount of views the video had, and the amount of likes and dislikes the video currently had, as well as whether they were demonetized or not. This data was then normalized by the normalized function. As of now there is no intention to scale data that was collected. The neural network was trained on half of the collected data, the max iter was 3,000. There was one hidden layer of three nodes, and the random state was one. This NN was tested using the score function to see the amount of correct guesses on the second half of the data. The NN was also tested using cross validation.
